#Accuracy checklist#

The first job of a reporter is to get it right. It's a simple concept, and very easy to screw it up. To get miles ahead, use this simple checklist.

###While reporting###

|Status|Item|
|------|----|
||Ask sources to spell their names, first and last.|
||Ask sources to spell their full title.|
||Ask sources for the source of any numbers cited|
||Ask sources for documentation on facts cited to support an argument|
||If the story is ongoing, ask what others have incorrectly reported|


###While writing###

Make a digital copy of your story and highlight every fact in the story, putting a checkmark next to every verified item after checking it.

|Status|Item|
|------|----|
||Verify spelling of each proper noun.|
||Verify titles of sources with your notes and/or online staff directories at their employer.|
||Double check any calculations done in the story.|
||Compare any number used in the story to the original source of that number.|
||Verify correct AP style on all addresses.|
||Verify correct AP style on all numbers.
||Compare quotes to notes or interview transcripts.|
||Verify quotes and paraphrases are properly and correctly attributed.|
||If you use a phone number in a story, call it to be sure it works and is correct.|
||Read each word slowly and carefully to ensure it's the correct word. Spellcheck will not catch you spelling the wrong word correctly.|
||Read the story out loud to find rough sentences or missing words.|
